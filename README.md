# 🔥 Yo, Meet KAI — My First Animation Drop!

Welcome to **KAI** — my first-ever animation experiment, built purely out of curiosity and creative exploration!  
This is an animated website that blends **2D and 3D animations** to create a minimal yet classy user experience.

> ⚠️ Note: **KAI** is an open-source character (not originally mine).  
From next time, I'll be designing my **own custom characters**, so stay tuned! 👀

## 💬 About the Build

This page was all about learning **how to integrate Spline’s 3D magic into real-world web design**.  
Instead of going heavy on UI clutter, I kept things minimal, letting the animation and vibe speak for themselves.

From **next projects**, I’ll be designing and animating **my own characters**, giving my websites a personal, original feel. 💫
